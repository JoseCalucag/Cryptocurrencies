 This project outlines the preperation steps on investing into the cryptocurrency market by applying unsupervised machine learning methods. There are 4 parts to this python notebook attached outlining what this project covers:
 1) Preprocessing of a cryptocurrency dataset.
 2) Reducing the dimensions to apply the Principle Componenent Analysis (PCA) algorithm.
 3) Applying the K-means algorithm to create an elbow curve graph and a clustered scatter plot.
 4) Based upon the PCA data of part 2, we'll use the methods in Part 3 to create a new scatter plot and table to view possible tradable cryptocurrencies.
